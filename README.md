# BIRDS

I allways been fascitaned about the movement of animals in groups. 
Sometimes I need to be alone and stop listening the noises of the city, and then I find myself sitting on the middle of nature, finding the pace I need.

On one of those times I thought that it could be great to translate the bird's dance into a canvas, and be able to see it whenever I want.


#Flocking

Quoting wikipedia:

Flocking behaviour is the behaviour exhibited when a group of birds...

## Rules

1 ) Separation, birds mantain a minimum distance between members.
2 ) Aligment, avoid exiting the group
3 ) Cohesion, steer towards average position of neighbours
4 ) Leader, one of the members of the pack becomes the leader, and has the chance to change direction. Randomnly various members of the pack can become leaders when the movement separates the group in various. 
5 ) United, several leaders try to merge the groups.
6 ) Fear, fear randomly can change the initial movement of the pack
7 ) Low number of interaction partners. Birds modelate their rules by the 7 nearest birds.
